# Project Requirements

1. Determine what is causing returns
   - LEFT JOIN `Returns` table to `Orders` table
   - Make `Returned` field into calculated field where null values are 0 and `Yes` values are 1.
   - Build a scatterplot showing total sales vs. total returns aggregated by product subcategory.
   - Create a bar chart showing return rate by product category.
   - Analyze return rate by customer (filter by removing customers with only 1 order).
   - Visualize return rate with a map by a geographic measure (state, city, etc.).
   - Analyze return rate by a time measure (month, week, etc.).
   - Generate two-composite charts showing return rate for a mix of multiple factors (date, geography, product category, etc.).

2. Build a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns
   - Create a low-fidelity mock-up for your dashboard
     - Make 3 variations of sketches (pen-and-paper).
     - Scan or take photos for submission.
     - Choose favorite option to create in Tableau.
   - Create a dashboard template using empty containers to match mock-ups.
     - Take screenshot and submit.
   - Add your worksheets to the dashboard template.
     - Finalize the dashboard with markers, images, and titles.
     - Submit mock-up, template, and finalized dashboard.

3. Present Your Analysis and Dashboard
   - Construct a story arc for your presentation by drafting your story using only captions for each Story Point.
     - Create a duplicate of draft story (captions only) to submit including:
       - A summary of your analysis of returns (i.e., return measurement method, root causes).
       - An overview of each dashboard component explaining what is contained in each chart and how the chart should be interpreted.
       - A demonstration of how the dashboard should be used including how to interpret the dashboard, how to use filters to identify root causes, and actions to be taken after using
         the dashboard to identify root causes.
       - A conclusion with proposed next steps.
   -  Add content to your Story Points using existing and new worksheets.
   -  Deliver your presentation 
      - Prepare a 3-5 minute presentation of your Tableau story.
        - Can either use a screen recording or submit presentation in PDF format.
   
4. Submit project ZIP archive
   - README.md file (including link to workbook on Tableau Public)
